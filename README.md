This problem consists in the diagnosis of computerized cardiac tomography. The database contains 267 sets of SPECT images (patients) that have been processed to extract features that summarize the original SPECT images.
As a result, 44 feature models were created for each individual patient.
I used the sklearn library to import the neural_network module, pandas for reading the data from the .data file, sklearn.metrics for the MSE metric, math for the radical and numpy to be able to work with vectors.
